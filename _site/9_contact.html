The Balca stems from the button to develop a folk / Balkan group that contemplates inside the mind \"BANDANICO\" that distinguishes this band.

After more than 500 concerts, nationally and internationally, including tours in the USA, Russia and Mexico, the band have earned themselves a loyal fanbase, filling concert-halls with 500-1000 capacity. The well-known Berliner Schnauze meets international flair and hand-made warmth. BudZillus's concerts are like a big balkan wedding party – people singing along, people dancing, people sweating, both on stage and in front of it.
