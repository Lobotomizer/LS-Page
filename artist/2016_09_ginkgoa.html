                As a hybrid genre between Caro Emerald and Caravan Palace, they only have one idea in mind: to make generations of people dance, sway, and sing along to melodies that stay in your head long after GINKGOA has left the building, as long as the Ginkgo, their tree totem namesake, continues to survive. </p>

            <blockquote>They played more than 200 shows in China, the USA and Europe and gained several prices for their work. Together they form GINKGOA,- alias Nicolle Rochelle and Antoine Chatenet- and they create a colorful mix out of french chansons with american vibes and american songs with french touch. Their musical influences lie in current pop melodies, Swing of the old New York and it reaches to modern Electro. Inspired by artists such as Caro Emerald or Caravan Palace, they are a real experience
                when you see them live.</blockquote>
