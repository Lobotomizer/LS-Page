            <p>Chotokoeu was born in 2007 promoted by some friends who like to play percussion and guitar in squares and streets, the good vibes between components made it possible for more musicians to join the band and look for a place to rehearse. By
                2008, they record 3 songs, winning the 2009 Galiza Crea Contest with them. This prize allowed them to buy their van. At that point was impossible to imagine the thousands of kilometres they were about to do.

            <p>Their proposal was gaining more and more adepts and they closed this period sharing stage with Ojos de Brujo in their home city. 2012 was a turning point. They played at Sala Capitol (Compostela) with La Pegatina. A new original and powerful
                show was born, with theatrical moments and some juggling included. From this concert, their first album was released (Live in Capitol). With the venue fully crowded (800 people) and the good response of the audience, the band was ready
                to organise their first Iboga Summer festival. (Valencia, Spain)european tour (40 days, 20 concerts and 6 countires) playing at important festivals like mainstage Fusion Festival (Germany) with Shantel.

            <p>By 2013 their first studio album was released “Chotokoeu”. They presented it in venues and festivals through Galicia (“Castelo Rock” with O’Funkillo or “Son das Mámoas” with La Raíz) and festivals across Europe: “Kokopelli” or “Fiesta Mundial”
                with La Troba Kung-Fu. With their passion to organise events in new ways and forms, they created “Caravana de Emerxencias”, at Sala Capitol (full house again).They obtained a lot of media impact, arriving even to the UK.
            </p>

            <p>After releasing their 2o studio album “Saír a Voar” (registered in Pau, France), the band finished the year with an incredible average of 1 concert each 3 days. They presented the CD having full houses at Oviedo, León, Coruña and Madrid. They
                also won the Festival de Música e Trebujena (Cádiz) and they travelled abroad for their 6o european tour. They rocked the house in places like Hootananny (London), Counter Culture Festival (Utrecht) or Festival Open Air Zizkov (Prague).
                Also important festivals in Spain like Reperkusión sharing stage with Dubioza Kolektiv or Che Sudaka and Iboga Summer Festival with Gentleman, Fanfare Cioarlia or Asian Dub Foundation, becoming, as the organisers said, the most outstanding
                band of the festival By 2016 , the band combined the creation of a new show and the production of events with a year full of festivals like SonRías Baixas, Millo Verde or again, the Iboga Summer Festival , with artists like Goran Bregovic,
                Alpha Blondy or Kultur Shock.
            </p>

          <blockquote>Chotokoeu are an electrifying Ska, Reggae Fusion band with a maniacal concoction of music genres that will have you jumping and skanking all evening long to their infectious, dynamic and joyful sound. They mix up twisted ska, with undertones of gypsy punk, rock, exotic Spanish language, and dub reggae with sprinkles of dark surrealist tones accompanying the fevered vocals and raucous energy!</blockquote>
