        <p>Janeck’s uptempo beats or deep grooves have inspired devoted club-goers of his “La Bolschevita” nights and other parties all over Germany, as well as in Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Slovakia or Czech Republic, Kosovo, France or England for years with wild dance orgies. His unique blend of balkan tuba bass and klezmer melodies from his homeland Ukraine with cumbia and other tropical music, swing &amp; electroswing is his way to energize the dance floor.
