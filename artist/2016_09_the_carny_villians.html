            <p>The carny villains are a raucous circus show band from Bristol, U.K. Known for their high energy original stomping swing and ska with balkan-esque folk.</p>
            <p>Live they are full sensory theatrical experience. Clowning and antics that keep crowds laughing and dancing until the end where the entire place will be jumping.</p>

            <blockquote>This band of top musicians has travelled the world as house band for the Invisible Circus and impressively scored over 50 live shows; they’ve become a real standalone draw where the only thing for sure is to expect the unexpected. What you
                know you’ll always get is variety, theatre and fun as anyone who has ever seen them at Carny Ville can testify.</blockquote>
