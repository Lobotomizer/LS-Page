                His love of music started at an early age, growing up listening to the music of the greats, such as Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder and Django Reinhardt, paving the way for the unique eclectic sound he’s known for today. From his earliest steps in the music scene, to his latest minimal vintage production, Grant Lazlo always pays tribute to his many musical idols, by mashing beats and melodies from the greatest songbooks in history.
