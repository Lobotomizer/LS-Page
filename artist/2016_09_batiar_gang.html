            <p>There it is: the pure, bare bones of our Balkan-Blatnik-trash-mashup-Project with that highly tragic name Batiar Gang. We are eight young people from Leipzig, Saxony, Germany that decided to dedicate our live and liver to sex, Balkan music and vodka in November 2014. We, that is namely, Melanka (vocals/violin), Alex (guitar/vocals), Sebbel (drums), Josie (trumpet), Hannes (bass), Stefan (accordion/trombone), Tony (horn/trumpet) and Matze (baritone sax/clarinet) and all we
                do is music.</p>
