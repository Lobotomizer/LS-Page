            <p><strong>The British rock guitar phenomenon. Sucker punch solos and a gravel swilled belter of a voice.</strong></p>

            <p>The new album is a big, loud dirty affair. The band have once again enlisted producer Alex Beitzke (Jamiroquai, Florence and The Machine, Nigel Kennedy) and are currently laying down tracks at Dean Street Studios in London and Clifthouse Studios in Bristol. After a great year on the road, in the studio and in each other’s pockets, the band have refined their sound and this record represents a musical evolution, with John citing a melting pot of influences from Jack White and The Black Keys to Queens of the Stone Age, Black Sabbath, Hendrix, Zappa, Iggy Pop, Captain Beefheart and Led Zeppelin. Alongside the heavy electric guitar riffs, face-melting solos and unmistakeable growling vocals we have to come expect from John Fairhurst, this album is an outspoken expression of his view on the world and our position in it, and is due for release in late 2016.</p>

            <blockquote>If you’re sick of hearing second and third generation blues revivalists recycling smooth guitar licks and bland vocals (no, I’m not naming names) then this could be just the album for you; don’t file under easy listening.</blockquote>
