            <p>His sound merges a forgotten era of Swing, Jazz, Dixieland, New Orleans with the contemporary sound of Big band breaks &amp; bad boy bass.
            </p>
            <p>Some people call it Electro Swing, but he prefers "Ghetto Swing &amp; Swing Hop!" His music, although very close and important to the "electro swing" movement, borrows heavily from the old school hip hop breaks, Nu-school bass lines, dusty
                drum loops and dreamy jazz &amp; swing era samples.</p>

            <p>With his sound-mix of jazz breaks and abstract swinging beats with spoken word , Mr.Woox has created his own unique position as a DJ and beatmaker in his hometown and country.
