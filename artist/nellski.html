            <p>Nellski’s musical roots are electronic. Nevertheless, his DJ career began with Balkan brass music. First on stage and then in radio multicult.fm. It was not long until he was looking for combinations with electronic music. Of corse Electro
                Swing was added quickly. Today, his repertoire has grown immensely.

            <p>He combines the 4/4-beat with music of all corners of the world or juicy times and likes to play with nice memories of his audience. Without a doubt in Nellski’s world danceability and humor belong together.
