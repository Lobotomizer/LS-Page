            <p>Pep Alegria (aka Groovy Joy) and Pep Dur√°n join together their career as professional deejays to offer the most elegant Swing music with electronic flavors. A powerful trend, very popular in the North of Europe, recently reaching Spain through
                many advertising spots. A perfect product to create the best of the shows. Charisma and freshness along with a selection of authentic music are the values of a demanding audience, who wish to enjoy the perfect combination between art and
                entertainment.
