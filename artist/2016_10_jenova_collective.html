<p>Causing a scene amongst the UK’s hottest underground clubs and festivals, their ‘no holds barred, take no prisoners’ attitude has been relentlessly smothered over unsuspecting audiences all across Europe. Not afraid to go off the rails with tune selection you can guarantee these reprobates will hunt down and deliver dance-floor fillers and swung-out bombs for an all out infectiously pumping set that’ll have the whole discotheque bouncing.
  </p>
<p>The Jenova Collective have spent the last 2 years staring through the looking glass, dropping an extensive list of free downloads and remixes along the way. Never pinning themselves to one genre, previous tracks have taken influence from house, drum &amp; bass and glitch hop whilst still keeping their signature vintage sound along with a healthy serving of block-rocking bass and relentless energy.
  </p>
<p>Their debut release on Ragtime Records, Champagne Machine, went down a treat and they have loads in the pipeline. Continued support from top dogs in the game prove these guys are ones to watch for the future!
  </p>
<p>These guys are available as a 7-piece live band, DJ sets or DJ sets with live vocalists and instruments. Get in touch for a quote!

<blockquote>Energetic electro swing meets thumping drum and bass: there’s no better way to spend an evening in The Ballroom than by attempting to swing from its chandeliers to the sound of Jenova Collective.</blockquote>
