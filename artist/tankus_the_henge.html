        <p>The world of Tankus the Henge is uplifting and wild, dark and heartfelt. A six piece powerhouse of a band drawing visual and musical influences from old time Fairgrounds to modern day Circus; The Beatles to Tom Waits and Gogol Bordello to Radiohead, they embody a look and a sound that lies somewhere between their South East London home and the carnival town of New Orleans.</p>
        <p>
            With their charismatic frontman, Jaz Delorean, looking like a lost character from a Terry Gilliam film and the pump and grind of the Tankus the Henge sound generating a groove that makes it impossible to stand still, their live show ebbs and flows like a small boat on a turbulent sea.

            Any other band who billed themselves as "the most fantastic band in the world" would rightly quake in their boots at having to live up to such fanfare. Tankus the Henge defy you to contradict them!

            <blockquote>Intelligent, uplifting gypsy style jump about and stomp your feet music, Tankus the Henge bring colour and sound to life, as vivid and as vibrant as your psychedelic dreams […] A raucously sonorous and gloriously vintage-sounding six-piece band of incredibly talented musicians playing not just the usual guitars and drums, but a piano, trumpet, sax and even an accordion! And rumour has it there was also a trombone. I thought I’d imagined it but it was real.</blockquote>
