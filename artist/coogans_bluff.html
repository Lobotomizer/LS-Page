            <p>Where other bands stuck within their creative process or completely dissolve, COOGANS BLUFF managed to reinvent themselves during challenging times. Their singer left the band 2012 and bassist Clemens Marasus took the job whereupon their unique
                sound and own style completely emerged.</p>

            <p>COOGANS BLUFF is a band that knows how to combine the best of both worlds ... in fact best of some more worlds/far more than two actually. With a sound that is retro and contemporary at the same time they win over the hearts of Retro-Rock
                traditionalists and still show experimental, fresh and daring ideas. Buckle up, kick back and listen without distraction! We'll meet again in outer space.</p>
