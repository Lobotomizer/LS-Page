<p>Over the last few years, Leeds' based klezmer/Balkan beats/gypsy jazz bohemians Tantz have taken the UK world/roots music scene apart with their full-on musical attack on audiences across the length and breadth of this nation. With awesome musical chops, an energy not seen since punk rock's halcyon days and ability to turn a gentle world music festival crowd into a heaving, pogoing mosh-pit, there's something special about this band that manages to touch almost everyone who hears and sees them live, no matter what music they're into.
