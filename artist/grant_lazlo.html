              Grant Lazlo is Paul Hézard, a French electronic music producer from cosmopolitan Marseille who takes vintage sounds and brings them up to date with a sprinkling of electro. It’s sociable, party music, sure to make you smile and most importantly, guaranteed to make you dance.

                His love of music started at an early age, growing up listening to the music of the greats, such as Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder and Django Reinhardt, paving the way for the unique eclectic sound he’s known for today. From his earliest steps in the music scene, to his latest minimal vintage production, Grant Lazlo always pays tribute to his many musical idols, by mashing beats and melodies from the greatest songbooks in history.
