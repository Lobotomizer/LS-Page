            <p>Founded in 2008 by five local Berliners, BudZillus have developed into one of the German capital's most successful bands; their first two albums presenting a mix of swing, punk and balkan beat that created a very own Berlin-sound that started on the streets.</p>

                <p>After more than 500 concerts, nationally and internationally, including tours in the USA, Russia and Mexico, the band have earned themselves a loyal fanbase, filling concert-halls with 500-1000 capacity. The well-known Berliner Schnauze meets international flair and hand-made warmth. BudZillus's concerts are like a big balkan wedding party – people singing along, people dancing, people sweating, both on stage and in front of it.</p>

            <blockquote>It's insane balkan music, crazy like a young monkey, musically a wild mix of styles – a bit of
              swing, a bit of ska, a lot of polka. But it's not about the genre, it's about the huge excess in
              itself, the exuberant, pure energy. The jokey lyrics are thrown out like you'd chuck vodka
              glasses at a wall with the aim of shattering them today to find happiness tomorrow.</blockquote>
