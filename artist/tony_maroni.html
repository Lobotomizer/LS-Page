          <p>Whenever Tony Maroni takes the stage, even the most weary of spectators begin to move their bodies. Inspired by jazz, blues and rock’n roll, he experiments with a range of the styles and genres of electronic dance music. He first encountered Electro Swing in 2011 and was struck by its jazzy melodies and driving electro beats and his lively and melodic sets ensure that concert-goers go home in high spirits. Tony Maroni is often joined on stage by saxophone player Cab Canavaral (Klub Shwing) and the live shows, with their unique sound and originality, guarantee the audience a rare glimpse at a class outfit. In 2012 the started the event series „Swing It!!!“ which is grown to a fixpoint in the viennese vintage scene.</p>

        <p>In 2012 he found “The Swingpack” with Andy Regler.</p>
